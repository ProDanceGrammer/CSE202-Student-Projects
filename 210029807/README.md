# Assignment

I have created my program using five high-order functions. I used a Python language to make it. There are one import *from functools import reduce*.
Five high-order functions are map(), filter(), reduce(), compose_function() and say().

Also, I used some of the functions inside.

## Map
Here, I have created a function that returns an integer number multiplied by two. It is called *twice()* and a *map()* function will use it for a list, which will be entered by a user. As a result, when a user will start a program, the program will ask for a list of numbers. If a user enters not only integers in the list, then it will ask to rewrite a list again after restarting the program. If everything is correct, then the program will print a list of numbers multiplied by two.

## Filter
Here I have created a filter, which return a list of planets, which are in our solar system. A program asks for a list of planets. Then a user has to write a list of names of planets. If it is in the solar system, then a program will return this list with only solar-system planets.

## Reduce
To create a reduce function, we need to import *functools* to the code. Also, I created a function *ask_numbers_list()* to get a list of numbers in any of the higher-ordered functions. Then I created a *reduce()* function. There is a function *add()* which returns a sum of elements. Reduce function returns a sum of elements that will be entered by a user.

## Composing
For composing a user, three of my own functions: *add_3(), mul_5(), and sub_1()*. They make calculation with the numbers. After that, I composed it in one function, *add_sub_mul()*. And I used it in printing function. A program asks only for a number from a user. If it is not a number, it will return a text with the error text, and it will ask to restart a program. If it is a number, it will use my three functions and print a result of arithmetical calculations.

## Saying (whispering or shouting)
A program will ask about the type of speaking, either whispering or shouting. Then it asks the text to say to the user. Then there are printed low letters of text if the user chooses whisper type, and capital letters will be written if the user chooses a shouting type of speaking. If there is no one of type, or type would be written incorrectly, then a program will return an error with text and ask to restart itself.

## Conclusion
I finished my project. It is also good at testing. I have created several functions to avoid errors, which can be created by a user.
